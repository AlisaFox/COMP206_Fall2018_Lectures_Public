# Practice Material for Our Bootcamp (work in progress)

The format of Tutorial 3 will be a whole afternoon lab session where you can sit down and write C code with help from Dave and the TAs. In order to give us some material to work on, we'll list good resources to browse for code samples and challenges that you might find helpful to practice the 206 concepts. If you dont find something particular that you're looking for here, post on the My Courses Discussion board and we'll try to add it.
